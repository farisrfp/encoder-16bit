# Binary Encoder 16 to 4 With Enable

This PCB project is a binary encoder with 16 inputs and 4 outputs, with an enable input. The encoder converts a 16-bit binary input value into a 4-bit binary output value. The enable input allows the user to control when the encoder is active, allowing the output to be held in a known state when the encoder is not in use.

Overall, this project is a PCB design, with schematics created using Eagle and a 3D model created using Fusion 360.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed on your computer:

- Eagle
- Fusion 360

### Installing

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/farisrfp/encoder-16bit
```
2. Open the `skematik.sch` file in Eagle to view the schematics.

3. Open the `fp.iam` file in Fusion 360 to view and edit the 3D model.

4. Use the 3D modeling software to export the 3D model in a format that can be previewed, such as STL or OBJ.
